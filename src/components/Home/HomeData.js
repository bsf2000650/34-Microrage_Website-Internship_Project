They are extremely capable team who discussed the entire job scope with me and understood the full expectations and deliverables for the project then implemented the appropriate components to deliver a very user friendly site. I do not have deep technical knowledge of the development tools/process needed to implement a complex and dynamic website (backend, database, frontend, UI/UX, etc) but that is where Imran and his team’s technical expertise took my conceptual details to full implementation. This effort was an initial working model of the core feature set, we are now moving to a second phase adding multiple new and more complex features.',
